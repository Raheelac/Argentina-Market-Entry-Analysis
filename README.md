# Argentina Market Entry Analysis

This report evaluates the economic feasibility of expanding MNC Corp., a U.S.-based apparel company, into the Argentine market. Through a comprehensive macroeconomic analysis, our team assessed Argentina's key economic indicators and their implications for international business expansion.

## 📌 Project Overview

Argentina presents both opportunities and risks for business expansion. While the country benefits from a stable GDP per capita, high literacy rates, and strong human development indicators, it also faces substantial economic headwinds such as inflation, currency depreciation, and limited economic freedom.

## 🔍 Key Factors Analyzed

- **GDP Per Capita & Real GDP Growth**
- **Unemployment Rate**
- **Exchange Rate Volatility**
- **Inflation Trends**
- **Interest Rates**
- **Economic Freedom Index**
- **Human Development Index (HDI)**
- **Literacy Rates**

## 🧐 Conclusion

While Argentina has foundational strengths, the report concludes that due to the current economic instability—particularly high inflation and weak fiscal policy—expansion is not recommended at this time. We advise continued monitoring of Argentina's economy for future consideration.
